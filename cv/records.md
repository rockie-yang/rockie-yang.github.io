Analyzing Jenkins data with Spark and Zeppelin

Jenkins is widely used for Continuous Integration and Continous Delivery across a lot of companies and it is pretty easy to build CI/CD workflows with it. However, detailed analysis of workflow execution results is not always easy to achieve and visualise in a convenient form. This talk presents some ideas on how to utilize Spark for collection and transformation of Jenkins logs and to perform interactive analysis and visualization with Zeppelin and Highcharts as a frontend. We will have a look into what kind of insights can be extracted from Jenkins test reports, how to provide faster feedbacks on test results and how to prioritize tests execution based on this data.

Speaker bio: 
Rockie Yang is a passionate software developer currently working for Ericsson. He has designed software architecture for embedded system, inter process communication, multi tenant queue system. He enjoys working between business and implementation, eager to see business cases flawlessly transformed implementation with simplicity in mind. He recently working on HDFS, Spark, Zeppelin, and Highcharts and released zeppellin-highcharts to add great visualization library Highcharts to Spark ecosystem.

## Apache Spark

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. Programs can run up to 100x faster than MapReduce.

Usually we need explore the dataset before we do real machine learning. It would be great if we could explore huge dataset and plot various diagrams with just with few lines of codes.

We possibly need see how the result is in a visual way when and after we did data analysing.

We possibly like to share charts with others just send one single file. It would be great if ALL interactive features can be kept.

Rockie Yang, Senior Data Engineer @ ThinkBigAnalytics would like share his experience on Spark Visualisation with Highcharts with his own open source project spark-highcharts.
